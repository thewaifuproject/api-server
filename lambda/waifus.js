Rin is reared as the successor to her family's magecraft, instructed by her father Tokiomi Toosaka to prioritize sorcery over her own interests.\r\n\r\nTwo centuries ago, the Toosaka House, in collaboration with the estates of Makiri and Einzbern, helped found the Fuyuki Holy Grail Wars. The land of Fuyuki City, which possessed the second greatest spiritual power in all Japan, was owned by Rin's ancestor, Nagato Toosaka; at the behest of the Einzberns, he provided his property as battleground for present and future wars. Nagato was a kirishitan, as well as a pupil of Zelretch; these titles gave him considerable influence in both the Mage's Association and the Church, allowing the Toosaka family to participate in the Holy Grail Wars, free from harassment by either organization.\r\n\r\nRin was brought up as the successor to her family's magecraft, and was instructed by her father to prioritize magecraft over her own interests. Ten years ago, Tokiomi Toosaka was selected as a Master in the 4th Holy Grail War, and Rin was entrusted to take care of the Toosaka estate until his return. Her mother, Aoi Toosaka, was left in a debilitated state from the war, so her care was left to her guardian, Kirei Kotomine.

She was the official leader of Squad 13.\r\n\r\nDue to her feelings for Hiro, she struggles between her selfishness and her responsibilities as a leader. Out if the entire squad, she alienates Zero Two the most and almost succeeds in separating her from Hiro for good until she realizes Zero Two is the only one Hiro loves, which prompts her to give up on him for the sake of his happiness and she eventually finds a new love in Goro at the end of the series.\r\n\r\nIchigo has soft green eyes and a petite build, being the shortest among the parasites in Squad 13. She wears her straight and short blue hair in a razor-cut hairstyle, where her hair hangs lengthier on the right side of her face. She has free-falling bangs that mostly covers her right eye and one long strand of hair on the left side of her face. She also wears a white hair clip holding back the bangs on her left side, which was a gift from Hiro. From Episode 09, she loses it but later gets a similar one from Goro. She dons the standard Pistil Parasite uniform.\r\n\r\nIn Episode 24 when she has become an adult, Ichigo's hair is more evenly-cut and longer on the right side. Her fringe is also cleaned up and her bangs on the left side are completely held back by her white hair clip.\r\n\r\nIchigo is an honor student who is seen as a natural-born leader. Because of her high aptitude, she was chosen as Squad 13's Leader. While normally a very considerate and level-headed person, her crush on Hiro impairs her judgment, especially as regards to his possible partnership with Zero Two. She initially hated the possibility of a stranger like Zero Two becoming Hiro's partner. One of her motivations for agreeing to be Hiro's partner in the training match was because she believes she should be the one to bring out his full potential.\r\n\r\nAs a leader, Ichigo is reliable, responsible and serious. Despite her serious disposition, Ichigo is capable of giving some notably snippy remarks, as seen in her interactions with Nine Alpha. She is also very considerate and caring for her friends. She tries to see everything in a good light, even if she herself doesn't want to. She can also be encouraging towards her squadmates and insist that teamwork is important for all of them to survive. However, she is strongly emotional and has always been impulsive and driven by her feelings. She is forced between acting as a leader and her own feelings, such as knowingly putting Hiro's life on the line while also acknowledging he's needed, this strain of commanding weighs her down. She would initially let her personal feelings get to her head when in a crucial mission, only to reflect over it when being placed in a dangerous situation. She would think about her poor skills as a leader and blame herself for her putting her friends in danger. She also expresses her anxiety more inside her FRANXX than she does outside of it and is seen breaking down, only to be supported by her FRANXX partner, Goro.\r\n\r\nShe has admired and been fiercely protective of Hiro ever since childhood, and supports Hiro the best she can. She is not afraid to voice her own opinions and get people to follow her orders as a leader. She has been deemed by Zero Two on several occasions as \"bossy\". Despite that, Ichigo does sometimes not say what she truly wants to and is able to put her feelings aside for others if she wants to. This is shown when she lied to Hiro saying she always had seen him as a sibling for his sake and for the sake of the fact that he could only pilot a FRANXX with Zero Two, when in reality she didn't want Hiro to pilot with Zero Two at all due to her feelings towards Hiro and the dangerous risks it could bring him. She is a straight-laced and straightforward person but also always follows the orders she receives, and held a deep respect for Papa.\r\n\r\nOver the series, Ichigo slowly learns to put Hiro's feelings and Squad 13's well-being before her own. She learns to accept and support Hiro and Zero Two's relationship, and become nicer to Zero Two to the point of considering her an integral part of Squad 13. She becomes just as fiercely protective of the others, including Zero Two, as Hiro. This is further emphasized when VIRM left earth and abandoned humanity; Ichigo becomes so dedicated to looking after the others and ensuring they have enough food, clean water, etc. for survival that she forgets to take care of herself, until she collapses outright in the fields. She also becomes a much better leader; she learns to see the big picture and not let her tunnel-visioned emotions consume her, making decisions that benefit the whole group rather than just Hiro or her designs for him, and she isn't as badly shaken when things go wrong.", "tags": [{"id": 1003, "name": "Mecha Pilot"}, {"id": 1014, "name": "blue hair"}], "display_picture": "https://images.waifuchain.moe/52.jpeg", "slug": "ichigo", "alternative_name": "\u30a4\u30c1\u30b4", "birthday_year": "", "waist": "0.00", "age": null, "creator_id": 16863}, {"origin": "Japan", "weight": "0.00", "creator": {"rolename": "", "id": 118, "name": "AkaTenshi"}, "series": {"description": "The student-filled Academy City is at the forefront of scientific advancement and home to the esper development program.

Jinx hijacked the occasion to unleash the first of many crime sprees; bridges were blocked with stampeding livestock freed from Count Mei's menagerie, scores of roads were shut down by explosions that made them impassable, and every street sign in the city was moved and placed somewhere new. Jinx had succeeded in spreading chaos throughout the streets and bringing the city to a halt. It had been a good day.\r\n\r\nThe wardens attributed her crimes to chem-punk gangs, rounding up dozens of known troublemakers and sending them back down to Zaun. Having others get the credit for her manic schemes didn't sit well with Jinx, and so she made sure to be seen at every future crime scene. Reports circulated of a mysterious, blue-haired Zaunite girl, but talk of her carrying chemtech Flame Chompers!.png explosives, a shark-mouthed Switcheroo!.png launcher and a Switcheroo! 2.png repeater gun were dismissed as preposterous. After all, how could a Zaunite chem-punk possibly obtain such lethal firearms?\r\n\r\nThe crime spree escalated in lunacy until Jinx detonated a series of explosives simultaneously throughout the city. A great many of the civic art structures erected by the Piltover clans were destroyed in fiery conflagrations that lit the sky in blazing pyrotechnics until dawn. Due to the late hour, no one was hurt, but numerous clan leaders were outraged at the sight of their great works reduced to rubble.\r\n\r\nJinx's crime wave continued for weeks, with the wardens' attempts to catch her thwarted at every turn. She tagged her crime scenes with insulting graffiti and taunting messages directed at Piltover's newest ally in the fight against crime, Enforcer Vi Vi. These bright pink tags finally revealed the name of Piltover's newest troublemaker: Jinx.\r\n\r\nWith every bold crime, Jinx became ever more legendary, with people in Zaun divided as to whether she was a hero for sticking it to the Pilties or a dangerous lunatic that would bring the full force of the wardens down to the undercity. That moment came even closer when Jinx sabotaged the Sun Gates and delayed the flow of ships by several hours - costing the city's ruling clans vast sums of lost revenue.\r\n\r\nHaving seen exactly which buttons to press, Jinx offered a challenge that couldn't be ignored - she threatened Piltover's money. She daubed the walls of the Ecliptic Vaults, one of Piltover\u2019s most secure treasuries, with a caricature of Enforcer Vi, together with details of exactly when Jinx planned to rob it.\r\n\r\nAn uneasy sense of anticipation settled on Piltover and Zaun in the weeks leading up to the appointed date of Jinx's heist. Many doubted Jinx would have the guts to show up and risk almost certain capture. When the day of the heist arrived, Vi, Caitlyn Caitlyn, and the wardens were taking no chances and had prepared a trap for Jinx around the treasury. The clocktower bells rang at the appointed hour, but nothing happened. It seemed Jinx had chickened out, but she was one step ahead of her would-be captors.\r\n\r\nJinx, despite the seeming recklessness of her actions, had a plan and it had been in motion for days. She had hidden herself within a modified coin-crate at the Toll Towers of the Sun Gates and had been delivered to the vaults two days previously. Jinx was already inside, and was even now wreaking havoc, leaving her signature pink tags on every gilded wall, swinging from the chandeliers, and leaving explosive surprises in every lockbox.\r\n\r\nHearing the cacophony from within, Vi realized what was happening. She stormed inside the building, ignoring Caitlyn's order to go in as a team. The battle they fought tore the vaults to pieces in a back and forth chase of explosions and demolition. Eventually Jinx and Vi confronted one another in the deepest, most secure vault. No one knows what passed between them, for Vi had pursued Jinx far ahead of the others. With the two of them trapped together underground, Jinx fired her rockets into the ceiling of the vault, and the entire structure collapsed. The wardens in the upper reaches of the vault escaped before the building came down, but Vi was left trapped inside. Only by hiding in the same lockbox Jinx had used to break in was she able to avoid being crushed to death. Eventually she punched her way out from the ruins, wondering for a moment if Jinx lay dead somewhere in the ruins, only to see one last tag left in the patterns of destruction - a final taunt daring Vi to catch her. No trace of the blue-haired hellion could be found, and to add insult to injury, not a single coin had been taken from the vaults.\r\n\r\nJinx remains at large to this day, and is a constant thorn in Piltover's side. Her actions have inspired copycats among the chem-punk gangs of Zaun as well as numerous satirical plays, sayings and the like throughout both cities. Her ultimate end-game (or why she is seemingly obsessed with Vi) remains a mystery, but one thing is certain: her crimes are continuing and growing in sheer audacity.", "tags": [], "display_picture": "https://images.waifuchain.moe/64.png", "slug": "jinx", "alternative_name": "", "birthday_year": null, "waist": "0.00", "age": null, "creator_id": 702}, {"origin": "The Empire", "weight": "0.00", "creator": {"rolename": "", "id": 4713, "name": "yrulaughing"}, "series": {"description": "Night Raid is the covert assassination branch of the Revolutionary Army, an uprising assembled to overthrow Prime Minister Honest, whose avarice and greed for power has lead him to take advantage of the child emperor's inexperience.

During her first appearances, she comes across slightly air-headed and hot-tempered. In the official art book, she is described as a person who \"drips with dissatisfaction the moment she opens her mouth\" and tends to be in trouble with her classmates. She is also mentioned to be a bit too talkative with an overly carefree attitude.\r\nHowever, Junko's real personality that is revealed at the conclusion of the Mutual Killing incident of Class 78th is notably different. Her true personality appears to be very apathetic and easily bored, to the unhealthy and abnormal degree. Because of this, her behavior and mannerisms tended to be extremely erratic and unstable by her own autonomous design; keeping up one \"appearance\" for too long bores her, which causes her to often switch between different personas. However, she is capable of maintaining one persona for extended periods of time when necessary, such as when she was overseeing the students through Monokuma. Junko's \"moods\" included (but were not limited to) her Monokuma persona, sickening cuteness, severe depression, clinical sophistication, and haughty superiority. She switched between \"moods\" regularly, often imitating other students' expressions, which made for a highly unsettling conversation to the survivors. While entering the Hope's Peak Academy as one of Class 78th students, she often talked in her narration-style and writes it in a notebook.\r\n\r\nAbove all, Junko was deeply obsessed with despair, having found despair to be the most (and possibly the only) enjoyable emotion for her, whether it be the inflicting of despair unto others, or suffering from despair wholeheartedly. This made her extremely dangerous, as she wished to make the whole world feel absolute despair. However, this also often proved to be her biggest weakness, as she gave her opponents a \"fair\" chance to defeat her in order to make their despair all the greater if they fail, and happily welcomed her own despair if her plans fail. Both Junko herself and the game's creators have confirmed that she truly has no reason to do things she does other than despair itself, which makes her all the more dangerous and unable to reason with.\r\n\r\nIn Danganronpa/Zero, it's revealed that her love for despair developed at quite young age due to an unknown reason, and that her true talent is her near supernatural analytical skills. It's also shown that under her amnesiac state, Junko doesn't show a thirst for despair or particularly strong hate for boredom, implying that her constant case of forgetfulness had spared her from embracing despair again. However, the return of her memories brought her back to her former ways. In Danganronpa 3, it's finally revealed that similar to Izuru Kamukura, her talent is the reason why she is easily bored with the world and seeks out unpredictable despair to free herself from the said boredom.\r\n\r\nAs a mastermind and leader of Ultimate Despair, Junko was shown to be highly intelligent, cunning, somewhat impulsive, and extremely manipulative, violent and cruel without remorse. She was both physically and mentally abusive, highly toxic individual. She manipulated people into falling madly in love with her and used their weaknesses, their despair, against them. Things like hope, peace, and happiness disgusted her, but she sometimes gave hope to others, only to turn it into despair later. She often manipulated people into doing bad things instead of directly doing them herself, and then had a habit of blaming these manipulated people and claiming it wasn't her fault, as a part of proving her point that despair exists in everyone and that hope will naturally lose to that despair. While she is very skilled, Junko can also lie and cheat to further her own goals, even if it's hypocritical and goes against her beliefs. It should be noted that even though she claims despair is the great unknown, in the end the road of despair went exactly the way she had planned.\r\n\r\nWhile very abusive and cruel even towards her loved ones, it's implied that she felt at least some care for them, in her own messed-up way. It is interesting to note that the two people who Junko loved the most (Mukuro and Yasuke) are the only people shown in canon to be killed directly by her: Mukuro through the Spears of Gungnir and Yasuke through stabbing, whereas most of her other victims were killed indirectly through executions. This is likely because killing those she holds most dear would cause her great despair and to Junko, the greater the despair, the better.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kazutaka Kodaka and Junko's voice actress, her personality in Side: Despair is more natural version of her, closer to her true self and more neutral, before she started changing her personalities regularly. This seems to imply that her behavior in the first game is a result of decreasing mental health and deeper sinking into despair, explaining the more jaded and apathetic personality.", "tags": [], "display_picture": "https://images.waifuchain.moe/167.png", "slug": "junko-enoshima", "alternative_name": "", "birthday_year": null, "waist": "0.00", "age": null, "creator_id": 702}, {"origin": "Kalos", "weight": "0.00", "creator": {"rolename": "", "id": 654, "name": "Uraby_"}, "series": {"description": "Pokemon are peculiar creatures with a vast array of different abilities and appearances; many people, known as Pokemon trainers, capture and train them, often with the intent of battling others.

She claims she had received the command of God to fight. She heard the Lord\u2019s lament that the world changed straight into hell. The Lord wept into sorrow as no one could stop it and people were not even allowed to live simply, and were compelled to become either beasts or food. Conflict never ended, and blood continued to rain incessantly and soak the land. She received a revelation from the Lord, the voice contained no glory or victory, no obligation or sense of purpose but only the Lord laments. She caught his small, feeble murmurs that everyone else failed to hear. She responded by throwing away her life as a simple villager and the joy of loving someone and being loved back. Furthermore, there would be no compensation. She knew she would surely be scorned by the masses of both enemies and allies alike. It was a very terrifying thing to contemplate. It was mad for a mere village girl from the countryside to leap onto the battlefield where people\u2019s killing intent swirled about. She could not turn her back on the Lord's cries. She decided to devote her life to oppose this world\u2019s hell to help stop the Lord\u2019s tears and soothe Him. She clad her armour on her body, hang a sword on her waist and carry the flag. She fought alongside with Gilles de Rais.\r\nHaving been born to a peasant family, Joan never knew the contents of the many books of prayer. She did try hard to learn them, but it seems she was simply born incapable of reading or writing. The most she ever managed was learning how to sign her name. While she worried about this, in the end, she decided that she needed little more in order to pray to the Lord. As she recalled, one of her comrades whom rode beside her, Gilles, once laughed and promised her that that was more than enough.\r\nThey say that in reality all that happened was that she used tactics that the knights of that time didn't use out of contempt and honour. She is noted to be one of the Heroic Spirits in recent history who utilized the power of the Counter Force to accomplish her deeds as a hero.\r\nBoth Jeanne and Gilles were decorated as saviors and national heroes by King Charles in the cathedral with the ars nova melody playing in the background.\r\nJeanne was put to death at Place du Vieux-March\u00e9 in Rouen. Scorned by words of damnation as she was led to the pyre and feeling only slightly pained as she endured it, she had already abandoned emotions such as fear, disappointment, and regret from the outset of her battles, so she was able to walk towards her death without faltering in her steps. As she unconsciously reached for the cross that had been at her chest until they took it from her, she felt some sadness as there was nothing to support heart. Shortly after, she was given a wooden cross fashioned by an Englishman who revered her, thanking him quietly as he knelt and wept. Her hands were tied to a wooden stake behind her, and the priest present completed the recitation of her final judgement before throwing the torch upon the pyre. As they believes that the loss of the flesh was the greatest of fears, it was the cruelest punishment that could be laid upon her.\r\nThe flames began to burn her skin, scorch her flesh, and char her bones, all while she spoke the name of the Lord and the Holy Mother against those who denounced her prayers as only a lie. She could only find such thoughts strange, believing that prayers are nothing more than prayers, no matter to whom is prayed, that carry no intrinsic truths or falsehoods. Although she wished to tell them of the thought, she was unable to produce any sound. As she burned, she saw visions of her past, her ordinary family in her rustic village and herself, \"the fool who ran away and tossed all of that aside.\" Having known how her journey would end from the start, she felt that she may have certainly been foolish in her actions, that she may have been able to lived a regular life, gotten married, and lived together with her husband and child.\r\nHad she simply shut away the voice and abandoned the lamenting soldiers, she could have had that life, but felt that it was not a mistake to have walked her path due to those she had saved. She knew from the moment she chose to take to battle that she would have such an end, and she felt that she would never come to self-derision for her choices. Her past, impossible futures, and the cruel reality before her were meaningless before her prayers, offering herself that even if all other condemn her that she would not betray herself. Rather than continue to look back on her path or crave for another future, she only wished for a silent rest. Within the savagery, she only kept a single prayer within her heart to the very end, one unblemished by regret and filled with sincerity. As she said her final words, \"...O Lord, I give myself to You...\", her consciousnesses ended and she was released from her suffering. Although the girl's dream ended there, \"the dream of La Pucelle was only just beginning.\"\r\nHer death had caused Gilles de Rais to go insane, turn his back on God to practice black magic, and commit atrocities before he was captured and hanged to death.\r\n\r\nShe has no wish for the Holy Grail but if there were to have one, it would only be that the Greater Grail War be conducted correctly. She doesn't mind if the person wishes a personal desire in front of the Holy Grail. As long as it doesn\u2019t beckon the world\u2019s destruction, she would properly respect the wish.\r\nShe doesn't have a single regret regarding in her lifetime. She does not wish revenge or wish to be saved and it was enough for her to know the life that she lived alone.\r\nShe does not believe that God had forsaken her in her last moment but rather that the Lord has never forsaken a single person. There was just nothing he could have done. Praying, giving offerings, everything is an act not for oneself, but for the Lord. She believes prayer will heal the Lord's laments and sorrow. The moment her prayer began, she became separated from the world\u2014removed from the past, the future, and reality itself. She was there not for any particular purpose, but simply to offer a prayer to God. By doing so, the course which she ought to take would come to be fixed. To her, every second of prayer is as important as every breath she takes; a day will not pass where she does not pray.

She becomes especially critical of wanting to be Hokage, as both Dan and Nawaki died trying to attain the title and the past Hokage have all died prematurely and, Tsunade argues, pointlessly because they held the position; she concludes that to be Hokage is a fool's job.\r\n\r\nTsunade has brown eyes and straight, shoulder-length blonde hair that she usually keeps tied in two loose ponytails. The Strength of a Hundred Seal - taking the appearance of a violet diamond shape - is clearly visible on her forehead. Although she was called flat-chested when she was younger, Tsunade has large breasts, which Jiraiya estimates to be 106 centimetres in circumference;[24] she is in fact widely regarded as the most beautiful kunoichi in the world.[25] Despite being in her fifties, Tsunade maintains the appearance of a young woman using the Transformation Technique. She has not been shown in full when not transformed, but what little of her body that is seen is heavily wrinkled and frail.\r\n\r\nTsunade often wears a grass-green haori with the kanji for \"gamble\" (\u8ced, kake) written on the back, inside a red circle. Underneath she wears a grey, kimono-style blouse with no sleeves, held closed by a broad, dark bluish-grey obi that matches her pants. Her blouse is closed quite low, revealing her sizeable cleavage. She wears open-toed, strappy black sandals with high heels. She has red polish on both her fingernails and toenails and uses a soft pink lipstick. She wears the First Hokage's necklace for many years until she gives it to Naruto.\r\n\r\nBirthdate : August 2\r\nNinja Registration : 002302", "tags": [{"id": 679, "name": "shonen jump"}, {"id": 344, "name": "kunoichi"}, {"id": 1166, "name": "big breasts"}, {"id": 1350, "name": "kage"}, {"id": 191, "name": "strong"}, {"id": 1351, "name": "healer"}], "display_picture": "https://images.waifuchain.moe/358.jpeg", "slug": "tsunade", "alternative_name": "", "birthday_year": null, "waist": "0.00", "age": null, "creator_id": 1457}, {"origin": "England", "weight": "0.00", "creator": {"rolename": "", "id": 163, "name": "ydis>:O"}, "series": {"description": "The school romantic comedy revolves around a second-year high school student named Sorata Kanda who lives in Sakurasou, the dormitory for problem children at Sorata's school.

Asuka is designated as the Second Child (\"Second Children\" in the original Japanese versions) of the Evangelion Project and pilots the Evangelion Unit-02. Her surname is romanized as Soryu in the English manga and Sohryu in the English version of the TV series, the English version of the anime movie and on Gainax's website.\r\n\r\n\u201c\tAre you stupid?\t\u201d\r\n\u2014Asuka\r\n\r\nAsuka is only one quarter Japanese, which accounts for her Japanese name but European appearance. Asuka is a native of Germany, having been raised there, though her nationality is technically American. Asuka's native language is German, and in both the series and the manga she tends to curse in German. Asuka was born to an American father (unknown) and a German/Japanese mother (deceased). She is a child prodigy and has earned a university degree in an unspecified field as a teenager; she also speaks fluent Japanese, but has trouble reading and writing kanji. Asuka had years of training starting from a young age to become a pilot for the Evangelion. She is characterized by her red hair and equally fiery temper. Asuka is very proud of being an Eva pilot, and near-constantly wears her A10 nerve clips in her hair, because she wants everyone around her to know that she is a pilot. Asuka's iconic catch-phrase (always directed at Shinji) was \"anta baka?!\" (\u3042\u3093\u305f\u30d0\u30ab\u30a1?![?]), \"anta\" being a contraction of \"anata\" meaning \"you\" and \"baka\" literally meaning \"fool\" or \"idiot\". The official English voice recording renders this as \"What are you, stupid?!\"\r\n\r\nAsuka has red hair and blue eyes. She dresses up in a signature school uniform that includes a blue dress, white socks and a pair of black shoes. Asuka's hair is held together with her Interface Headset. To complete the ensemble, a red bow on her collar provides a centerpiece as well as a bit of contrast against her blue outfit.\r\n\r\nHer mother, Kyoko Zeppelin Sohryu, was a scientist of Gehirn's German branch of the Evangelion Project. When Asuka was four years old, Kyoko participated in a contact experiment with Unit-02 similar to the experiment performed by Yui Ikari with Unit-01. She survived the test but became insane, believing that Asuka's doll was her daughter and refusing to acknowledge the real Asuka, referring to her as \"that girl over there.\" She eventually commits suicide by hanging herself; Asuka found her body when she went to tell Kyoko the good news that she had been chosen to become an Eva pilot.\r\n\r\nAfter Kyoko's suicide, Asuka's American father remarried a German doctor.

However, Asuka protested against the idea and told her grandmother that she had to take care of herself for now on. From that day on, Asuka promised herself that she would never cry again. This causes her to repress a great deal of emotions, not to mention the emotional scarring that came from her mother's illness and death, leaving her twisted and vulnerable towards the end of the series.\r\n\r\nAsuka is a very proud individual, especially in her piloting, and comes across to others as proud and strong, with a very high opinion of both her appearance (particularly her recently \"busty\" body) and her skill as an Eva pilot. She is stubborn and finds it difficult to express her true feelings to others. She does not like being looked down upon or told what to do as she wants to be viewed as an adult. She is aggressive and can be very opinionated. However, this personality is a front that protects a very vulnerable and insecure girl, a side which the viewer sees in her dreams or thoughts.

Ino is quite knowledgeable about different types and meanings of flowers, sometimes making analogies to them when talking.\r\n\r\nDespite her assertiveness, Ino is a compassionate and kind person at heart, having been raised to embody the meaning of the bush clover: a blunt, candid love who treasures the bonds with her friends. It is these qualities that earned Sakura Haruno's friendship, defending Sakura from bullies who teased her and helping her become confident. Their warm friendship developed into a bitter rivalry over the following years, fueled by competition of Sasuke's affections. After the Ch\u016bnin Exams, Ino becomes impressed by Sakura's growth and they rekindle their friendship, while maintaining their rivalry on more amiable terms. \r\n\r\nHer birthday is 23 September.\r\n\r\nSource: http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Ino", "tags": [{"id": 679, "name": "shonen jump"}, {"id": 344, "name": "kunoichi"}], "display_picture": "https://images.waifuchain.moe/410.jpeg", "slug": "ino-yamanaka", "alternative_name": "", "birthday_year": null, "waist": "0.00", "age": null, "creator_id": 656}, {"origin": "Earth", "weight": "500.00", "creator": {"rolename": "", "id": 9869, "name": "Goderesky"}, "series": {"description": "", "id": 2381, "slug": "gijinka-mascots", "name": "Gijinka (Mascots)"}, "height": "0.00", "birthday_day": 15, "likes": 110, "id": 411, "bust": "0.00", "name": "The Trash Man", "birthday_month": "August", "trash": 741, "blood_type": "", "hip": "0.00", "description": "He has no soul", "tags": [], "display_picture": "https://images.waifuchain.moe/411.png", "slug": "the-trash-man", "alternative_name": "", "birthday_year": "", "waist": "0.00", "age": null, "creator_id": 9869}, {"origin": "Aldea Rosemary", "weight": "55.00", "creator": {"rolename": "", "id": 488, "name": "OppLov"}, "series": {"description": "", "id": 14, "slug": "fairy-tail", "name": "Fairy Tail"}, "height": "180.00", "birthday_day": 1, "likes": 716, "id": 412, "bust": "100.00", "name": "Erza Scarlet", "birthday_month": "January", "trash": 119, "blood_type": "", "hip": "90.00", "description": "Erza was a slave in the Tower of Heaven.
